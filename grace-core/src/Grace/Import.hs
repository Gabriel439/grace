{- | A resolver for an URI.

     When the interpreter tries to resolve an URI pointing to some source code
     it will try multiple resolvers sequentially and stops if one returns a
     @Just code@ value where @code@ is the source code of an expression.
     It will then try to parse and interpret that expression.

     Here are some good practices for the development of resolvers:

     * A resolver should handle exactly one URI scheme.

     * If a resolver encounters an URI which it cannot process (e.g. a
       @file://@ URI is passed to a HTTP resolver) it should return @Nothing@
       as fast as possible.

     * Exceptions thrown in resolvers will be caught and rethrown as an
       `ImportError` by the interpreter.
