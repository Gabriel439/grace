{-| A `Closure` captures the current evaluation environment in order to defer
    evaluation until the value of some bound variable is known

    You can think of @Closure name env expression@ as essentially the same thing
    as @\\value -> evaluate ((name, value) : env) e@, except stored using a
    first-order representation.  In fact, you convert to the latter
    representation using `Grace.Normalize.instantiate`.

    This provides efficiency comparable to a higher-order abstract syntax
    tree, except using a first-order representation.

{-| This type represents a fully evaluated expression with no reducible
    sub-expressions

    There are two benefits to using a type separate from the surface syntax for
    this purpose:

    * To avoid wastefully reducing the same sub-expression multiple times

    * To use a more efficient representation for reduction purposes

      -- The `Int` field disambiguates variables with the same name if there are
      -- multiple bound variables of the same name in scope.  Zero refers to the
      -- nearest bound variable and the index increases by one for each bound
      -- variable of the same name going outward.  The following diagram may

      -- This `Int` behaves like a De Bruijn index in the spcial case where all
      -- variables have the same name.

    | Lambda Closure
      -- The `Lambda` constructor captures the environment at the time it is
      -- evaluated, so that evaluation can be lazily deferred until the function
      -- input is known.  This is essentially the key optimization that powers
      -- the fast normalization-by-evaluation algorithm.
